**Abstract**

Motivated by an application to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) initiation studies, we propose a new treatment intervention dependent on the observed treatment process. We show there exist 1) estimators that are doubly and multiply robust to model misspecification, and 2) estimators that when used with machine learning algorithms can attain fast convergence rates for our proposed intervention.  

**Availability**

As per data confidentiality agreements, the data cannot be made publicly available because of the sensitivity of the information.

**Simulated data**

We conducted two simulation studies for our proposed multiplicative shift intervention distribution. Our first simulation findings show that the weighted ICE is more robust to model misspecification than IPW and ICE when the nuisance functions are estimated using parametric models. Our second simulation findings show that the TMLE with sample-splitting and cross-fitting is consistent as long as the nuisance functions are estimated consistently at fast enough rates using machine learning methods, which may not necessarily be n^âˆ’1/2.
